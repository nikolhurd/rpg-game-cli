# RPG Console Game

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my very simple RPG console game that I created with the goal of learning JavaScript. Navigate through a grid, find items, battle enemies and reach the goal.

## Features

- Move your character on a grid with emoji visuals
- Find magical items to enhance your stats
- Battle evil wizards
- Reach the trophy to win!

## How to use it

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run `npm install` to get the needed packages
3. Start with `node game.js`
4. Use arrow keys to move

## Project Structure

- `game.js` - Main game logic
- `entities.js` - Classes for Player, Enemy and Items
- `grid.js` - Grid creation and display
- `userInput.js` - Handles movement choices
- `events.js` - Random item and enemy generation

## Learning Notes

This project is a very simple game created specifically to learn JavaScript programming fundamentals. I focused on learning:

- Object-oriented programming
- Modular JavaScript
- Grid-based movement
- Random event generation

## Packages Used
